# 🎲 Tenzies Game - React Edition

This is my **first React project** — a simple and fun implementation of the classic Tenzies game!  
Players roll 10 dice and try to make all of them show the same number. Dice can be held between rolls to lock in values.

Built with ❤️ using React and Vite.

## 📌 Notes

,but I've added key improvements:

- Dice roll animations
- Persistent high scores (localStorage)
- Better accessibility

Smoother gameplayIt's a great intro to state, props, localStorage, and custom components!
